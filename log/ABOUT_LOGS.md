About Logs
==========

Logs are excluded via the ```.gitignore``` file, and thus are not captured in the GitHub project.

This folder is a placeholder for logs to be stored during testing and production runtime.

If you see an empty folder with only this file, it's just fine.  Don't worry.  Everything will be OK.
